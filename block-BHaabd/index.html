                <p>In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats?In our sitting or bedrroms,our libraries,in our kitchens and storerooms,our farms,barns,andrickyards,in our docks,our granaries ,our ships,and our wharves,in our corn markets, and other places too numerous to mention,how useful they are! In our ships,however,the rats oft set them at deflance;still they are great services.
             </p>
             <p>
             How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their home! How well Shakespear in Pericles,Act iii.,describes this kneen attention of the cat to its naturak pursuit!
             <p>The cat,with eyne of burning coal,Now crouches from(before) the mouse's hole.</p>
             </p>
             <p>A slight rustle,and the fugitive comes forth; a quick,sharp,resolute motion,and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plauge of rats and mice,as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by cats,as I was, and they will have lasting and king regard for them. </p>
